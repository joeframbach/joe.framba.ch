This year I signed up for the Reddit Pokemon Gift Exchange. The idea was to recreate the mural which appears in Season 1, Episode 2, around the 8:10 mark.

I started with `imagemagick`, getting the screenshot into a useful state.

{% include image.html alt="Cleaned up with a grid" src="/images/pokemural-grid.png" caption="Cleaned up with a grid" %}

Then I traced each legend onto 1/4" plywood, and glued it into another sheet to give some kind of layering effect.

There are many things I am not very good at, and artistry is on that list. I've never done anything like this before, and spent a lot of time at Michael's figuring out what kind of paint I'm supposed to use. Well, here's the finished product. I used acrylic paints and sponges for the large areas, and a $1 crayola brush from Target for the borders and features.

For a sense of scale, it is three feet tall and four feet long. With packaging, it just barely fits in the trunk of my car.

Fortunately, <a href="http://redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/probably-best-pokemon-gift-ever/">it survived the trip</a> from Pittsburgh to Missouri. My randomly-matched gift-receiver and his wife and corgis were very happy to receive it.
