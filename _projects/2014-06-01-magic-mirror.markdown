### Step 1

{% include image.html alt="" src="/images/magic-mirror-frame.jpg" %}

Gather a length of 1x3 and cut it into the appropriate lengths with a $10 plastic miter box,
while being very careful to not mess up the carpet that you just put a $4000 security deposit on.

### Step 2

{% include image.html alt="" src="/images/magic-mirror-plug.jpg" %}

Spend 4 hours whittling holes for the outlet and the on/off switch because the only thing you have in the apartment is a scalpel.

### Step 3

{% include image.html alt="" src="/images/magic-mirror-glass.jpg" %}

Order a two-way observation mirror at your local glass store. With a raised eyebrow they will ask why you need it. It will take two weeks to arrive.

### Step 4

{% include image.html alt="" src="/images/magic-mirror-monitor.jpg" %}

Take apart an expensive 22" monitor and put it in the frame. This one cost $90 at Goodwill.

### Step 5

{% include image.html alt="" src="/images/magic-mirror-cleat.jpg" %}
{% include image.html alt="" src="/images/magic-mirror-cleat-finished.jpg" %}

Build a [french cleat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_cleat) from scrap parts because your plastic miter box is only 4" across and the complete cleat set won't fit.

### Step 6

{% include image.html alt="" src="/images/magic-mirror-finished.jpg" %}

Spend the next three hours leveling the cleats and attaching them to the wall with toggle bolts. Hope it's level. You only get one chance.
