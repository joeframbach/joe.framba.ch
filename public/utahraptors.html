  <p>I fell asleep on my creative side and now it&#39;s all tingly and won&#39;t wake up. In lieu of something original, I present to you a poster I made nearly two years ago (18 Feb 2007) for Dr. George Novacky&#39;s Scientific Computation course at the University of Pittsburgh. This poster was entered in a departmental competition, yielding second place. Impetus was provided by Randall Munroe&#39;s brilliant webcomic, <a href="http://www.xkcd.com/135/">xkcd</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/raptors.pdf">Lifespan Persistence through Numerical Analysis of Initial Value Problems</a> deals with a true life-and-death scenario: which direction do you run if you&#39;re surrounded by three raptors?</p>

<p>Surprisingly, there is one solution that yields immortality, but it is highly theoretical. If you alter the conditions of the problem such that the &quot;Utahraptors sacrifice speed in favor of quick turning ability&quot;[1], and allow the human to have infinite acceleration to a maximum velocity of 6 m/s regardless of angular change, then the human may run around in circles without being devoured. Queue the Benny Hill music.</p>

<p>[1] &quot;The velociraptors can turn at any angle at any velocity. This has a large effect on the solution, and was only implemented after consulting with [Randall Munroe], who said, &#39;I actually remember seeing some research saying that Utahraptor may have sacrificed some speed in favor of quick turning ability, so there&#39;s some justification for that one. So I would say you let them turn as fast as they want, but they always run toward your current position (in reality, raptors are far more cunning than this).&#39;&quot; Contributed by Matthew Beckler, University of Minnesota.</p>
