  It's somewhat easy for you to read that, if you're a native English speaker. Try this one out.

  Give up? That's okay; I have no idea what it says either, I don't know Swedish. Although this raises another question: Can a machine figure it out, with a large enough training set? A few weeks ago I posed this problem to a coworker, and here's what resulted after an hour or so.

  ![Bigrams](/images/the-day-i-parsed-nothing-bigrams.png "Bigram counts for Alice in Wonderland, base 16 for smaller display size.")

  In short, this means that the letter-pair "ha" appeared 4fd16 (1277) times, while "xh" appeared once. Most likely, that "xh" appeared at a word boundary, i.e., one word ended with x and the next word began with h ("...trying to box her own ears..."). The idea here is that low bigram counts correspond to word boundaries.

  There are 107716 characters (a-z) in the text, so given an average word-length of 8 (I made that up), there should be 13464 words. This next part is tricky. A â€˜threshold' must be found. Any bigram with a count fewer than the threshold will have a word boundary inserted, and any bigram with a count higher than the threshold will be part of a word. I'll cut to the chase: k<=133 (8516) provides 13490 word boundaries (see the above table, find the cumulative sum for k<=133 yourself if you'd like).

  You get the point: It didn't really work out so well. As I was skimming through the results, I found this gem:

  Oh wow, check it out. I parsed *nothing*!
