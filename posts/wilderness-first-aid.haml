  This weekend I attended a 16-hour Wilderness First Aid course offered by the Wilderness Medical Institute of the National Outdoor Leadership School. Although appropriate for anyone planning to spend any amount of time in the wilderness, the certification is approved by many government departments, park services, and outdoor recreational organizations. It covers patient assessment, common emergency care, and spinal injury assessment and care [\[Full Schedule\]](http://www.nols.edu/wmi/courses/outlines/wildfirstaidoutline.shtml). I'd really recommend this for anyone; it's just useful information to have.

  As a related topic, the Pitt Outdoors Club needs trip leaders for the upcoming Fall semester. Recently, the university ruled that only those older than 25 may drive university vans for club trips. This put a huge hamper on our operations, since most of our large trips (Coopers, McConnells Mill, Seneca Rocks) use two 12-passenger vans plus a few student cars. If you're over 25, and have some current involvement with the university, we need you to drive us places. Please?
