        <title>Code Review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes good enough is good enough. Every code review has opportunity for improvement, but an over-eager reviewer can dampen both morale and productivity. It’s better to lead a horse to water than to dump a bucket on its head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, here are some short criteria for effective code review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can create either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a realistic scenario where the code will break as-written (a failing test case)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a realistic future product use-case where the code will be difficult to work with as-written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then I will present that scenario to the author and let them figure out what is wrong/non-optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, be fair and partial in your reviews, and use infinitive articles and no possessives. For example say “the function here can be rewritten like so” rather than “your style can be improved”.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Interviewing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When a resume comes along with an interesting side project listed, I want to ask about it. That’s hopefully why it’s on the resume: to start a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to grow as a developer is to build something, destroy it, and build it again. We all have the thought “what other ways can I build this?” in our heads as we’re building a project. Most times I have seven different ways to do something, and the hardest part is just picking one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in my opinion, a great interview question would be “how else could you have built this?”. It shows that the developer weighed the choices that we all inevitably have.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Markdown with Redcarpet</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am no longer using this renderer. I am now using Jekyll 3.0 with Liquid and kramdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;original-text-2013&quot;&gt;Original text, 2013:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown uses this syntax for placing images:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plain&quot;&gt;![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg &quot;Optional title&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting markup looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/path/to/img.jpg&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Alt text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Optional title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;`
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wanted the resulting markup to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/path/to/img.jpg&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Alt text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Optional title&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a few attempts to get this going, but in the end it was surprisingly
easy. I’m rewriting the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; method in Redcarpet, and telling Haml to use
my extended class instead of stock Redcarpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;haml&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;redcarpet&#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;CustomRedcarpet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Redcarpet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;alt_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;{link}&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;{link}&#39; alt=&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;{alt_text}&#39; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;{title}&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Haml::Filters::Markdown&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Haml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Base&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@renderer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Redcarpet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;CustomRedcarpet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@renderer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update-2015&quot;&gt;Update, 2015:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some component of Ruby 2.0.0, Haml, or Redcarpet decided to not work anymore. The solution was a slight modification, below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;haml&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;redcarpet&#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;CustomRedcarpet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Redcarpet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;alt_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;{link}&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;{link}&#39; alt=&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;{alt_text}&#39; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;{title}&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Haml::Filters&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;remove_filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Markdown&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Haml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Base&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@renderer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Redcarpet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;CustomRedcarpet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

        <title>Virginia Beach Marathon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I heard about the Virginia Beach Shamrock Marathon from a fellow Appalachian Trail hiker. It looked pretty cool. 16,000 people all dressed in green? Great. Free beer? Even better. Sign me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I looked into the logistics. It turns out there are no flights between PIT and ORF - they’re all routed through Detroit or Newark. Fortunately I like airports, so I picked the itineraries with the slightly longer layovers so I can explore a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotel situation taught me a valuable lesson in foresight. I had counted on crashing with that AT hiker. However, as the days passed by, and my messages weren’t returned, I needed to take some action. Couchsurfing has never let me down, but will it save me again with less than 24-hours notice? It’s crunch time. I drafted a desperate message in a way that made it sound not so desperate, and sent it out to 25 people. 25 very gracious, kind, welcoming people. So welcoming, in fact, that my phone rang three times while going through the security checkpoint at PIT. Within an hour of sending out the messages, I had not only a couch to sleep on, but also a ride from the airport. Chris and Brent, you rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were also hosting an Irishman from New Zealand, Thomas, who is traveling the east coast southbound to Florida. Unfortunately for those running marathons the next day, this means they were up til who-knows-when playing drinking games. Chris was happy enough to offer up his bed to me, which worked out because they were going to pass out on the floor downstairs anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6:00am, like a ninja I crept downstairs and out the door, barely a whisper - not like anyone would have been conscious enough to hear me anyway. The shoreline was six miles away, so I made sure to give myself at least two hours for walking plus an hour for pre-race whathaveyous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work and school keep me so busy I can’t possibly find an hour a week to run. Yeah, it’s pretty bad. So I was understandably nervous going into the run. As were about half the other runners. A minute before the start, the announcer asked, “Who is running their first marathon today?”, and a third of the crowd raised their hands. “Who didn’t train for this?” yielded many more hands and applause. I felt a little better about my condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course started in a huge crowd, with so many supporters for the first few miles, but it dwindled down quickly. After passing through Fort Story Navy Base, it followed a sectioned highway for a dozen miles to the turnaround. At mile 18, I felt not-so-good about my condition. I looked around and saw quite a few other people limping along with me. Well, the best I can do at this point is just finish, regardless of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I limped the last eight miles. The splits are telling:&lt;br /&gt;
First 7.0 - 1:08:21 - 9:45&lt;br /&gt;
Next 6.1 - 0:59:04 - 9:41&lt;br /&gt;
Next 4.9 - 0:55:36 - 11:21&lt;br /&gt;
Last 8.2 - 1:52:53 - 13:46&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let this be a lesson. If you’re going to run a marathon, it helps to run a bit beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GAP-CandO</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A large part of Pittsburgh’s 250th anniversary celebration was the completion (or near-completion) of the 150-mile Great Allegheny Passage, an initiative of the Rails to Trails program, connecting Pittsburgh to Cumberland, MD. From Cumberland, the GAP connects to the 185-mile C&amp;amp;O Towpath, extending to DC. Venture Outdoors hosted a 24-hour bicycle relay from DC to Pittsburgh during the anniversary celebration in October 2008, commemorating the independence of the American colonies, in which I rode a 20-mile section in Maryland, and the final 20 miles into Pittsburgh. So, for spring break this year, I decided to attempt the full length of the GAPCANDO trail to DC. As with all of my undertakings, it was a pretty bumpy ride and it didn’t pan out as planned, but I still mark it as a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the few weather-permitting weekends leading up to this trip, I went out for road trips and averaged 15mph for 4 hours, so I thought maybe 70 miles wouldn’t be so bad for the first day, and 90 would be do-able. Strike one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first 20 miles to McKeesport is incomplete and has many sections impassable by bike, so my dad shuttled me to McKeesport, but not before picking up a huge plastic sheet with a hood and buttons, in case it rained. I wore it for about 5 minutes before I took it off and never put it on again. Of course, it was more wet on the inside than it was on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;/images/gap-cando-trail.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gap-cando-trail.png&quot; alt=&quot;Trail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest here. The trail is really boring, and I underestimated it, horribly, so for future expeditions I’ll be sure to stick with road riding. On a road bike, you feel every rock, every stick, every dip, and every bump on the trail. The thin tires (23mm front, 25mm rear) cut deep in the dirt, greatly increasing the resistance from what wide knobby tires would give. Fast-forward eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I made it to Ohiopyle, 11 miles short, and way too dark to ride at night. As my luck goes, there was only one place to stay in the area, at a whopping $93 (during the off season!). I think there was a bird nest with loud chicks in the wall, or else the room next to mine had a TV on too loud all night. They’re not getting a thank-you card, that’s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day Two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohiopyle is dead in the winter, so I packed up early and finished up that 11 miles to Confluence (the original destination) hoping to hit up the River’s End Restaurant. Of course, it’s out-of-season and they’re closed. Sister’s was open, thankfully, and I enjoyed two rounds of breakfast. They’re getting a thank-you card, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next 40 miles made me very angry at myself for not doing enough research on the trail conditions. Apparently, dirt turns into mud after a heavy rain, and it tends to remain wet in cold weather. I spent nine hours on the trail, pumping uphill in two inches of dirt, and only made it 40-something miles. Just great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;/images/gap-cando-meyersdale.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gap-cando-meyersdale.png&quot; alt=&quot;Meyersdale&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meyersdale, PA. A++++ would visit again. The entrance to town has a large bulletin board with a map and phone numbers of every establishment in the area, including a HOSTEL for CYCLISTS! In one fluid motion I tore the phone out from the pack and had the number dialed. No answer. Oh well, where’s the bar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an hour or so I called again, with great success. The hostel is a basement room of the high school, fitted with ten bunks, showers, a foosball table, and a few couches. It was closed for the season, but with very little prompting I was let in and stayed the night free of charge. Thank you card, no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of the locals let me know that the Big Savage Tunnel is closed for the season. The BST is the longest tunnel on the trail, at 3300 ft., at the highest point of the trail, with no easy bike detour. So I mulled over my options at the hostel and decided to shuttle it. Queen City Taxi picked me up in the morning and shuttled 30 miles to Cumberland. While I’m a little disappointed about it, there’s not much else that could be done, especially since I have reservation deadlines made in Harper’s Ferry and DC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day Three&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C&amp;amp;O Towpath is absolutely wonderful. From here it’s all somewhat downhill, on well-traveled, well-packed, well-maintained solid trail. There are a lot of informational boards along the towpath, describing alongside the ruins the story of the towpath, its industries, and local geography; they provide a nice distraction from staring at trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ate lunch in Paw Paw, West Virginia, an interesting little town famous for the Paw Paw Tree, and a large unlit tunnel, built precariously into and alongside the flat rock side of the local hillside. After a short road ride, I passed the former well-known cyclist hostel which had recently been taken by fire. Authorities deemed it arson. Perhaps in the future it will be rebuilt. The first place I saw with food was Grandma’s Bed and Breakfast, which served a really good chili and roast beef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At nightfall I found myself in Hancock, MD, 60 miles down and 25 miles to Williamsport. MD. As the eternal optimist, I hoped to hit Williamsport because it’s a larger town with a higher probability of finding a decent cheap place to crash. Hancock provided a Motel 8 with a AAA member discount, friendly staff, a warm shower, a comfortable bed, and a convenient location close to restaurants and the food store. I swear they’re not paying me to say this, but it was pretty nice. However, the local teenagers are all assholes. A walk down main street in tights, cycling shoes, a tight undershirt, and a windbreaker (nothing matching) was quickly mocked by a bunch of kids hanging out on their pickup truck tailgates. Either that, or they were practicing their Adam Sandler impressions. Then the coolest guy in town barrels down the road, going at least 50 in his suped-up Mitsubishi. I guess there’s not much to do in this town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day Four&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good thing I didn’t get to Williamsport last night. Twenty-five miles from Hancock to Williamsport made the timing perfect for lunch at Desert Rose Cafe, the kind of place I think every town should have. Rose, the owner, really knows how to feed a traveler, and the “regulars” keep a lively, warm environment. Rose is trying to find room for an ice cream freezer and more seating, but I don’t expect it to stop there. I imagine the next time I stop through Williamsport, she’ll have an all-out diner on her hands. The Giant dealer across the street showed me around the trail detour. There’s a six-mile section that keeps washing out, so a hilly road detour was put in place, indefinitely. But a quick glance at a map can tell you the officially-sanctioned detour is terribly inefficient. It provides the shortest amount cut out from the trail, but at the expense of a large hill climb on a shoulder-less road. The alternative is to run straight from Williamsport to the end of the detour, mostly downhill and with a shoulder. Two more thank you cards to Williamsport. Good people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;/images/gap-cando-harpers-ferry.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gap-cando-harpers-ferry.png&quot; alt=&quot;Harpers Ferry&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miraculously, I arrived in Harper’s Ferry before 5pm. I checked in at Karan Townsend’s Towns Inn, dropped my bags, and headed out because everything closes at 5pm. The first stop was the ATC HQ to visit Babu Simba, a 2008 AT thru-hiker who I met in Port Clinton, PA, at the outfitter before shuttling to the Yeungling brewery. Unfortunately he was not there, but I was able to sign the register and reminisce for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day Five&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cold front passed through overnight, dropping the temperatures near freezing. I was not prepared at all for this; the coldest I’ve experienced this week was 45F, so I stopped by the outfitter in the morning and picked up a sweet $65 Marmot wind shell for $30. Then I reminisced about the time Baltimore Jack sold me a pair of Vasques at the same spot eight months ago. Babu was at the ATC HQ for the morning before heading out for a Loudon Heights hike, so I stopped by and he went over his itinerary for his Harpers Ferry to Florida bicycle ride, which I would rather be biking right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Harper’s Ferry, the towpath and the Appalachian Trail coincide for a few miles, until the AT veers north and the towpath continues east. I stopped at a white-blazed post and called my mom, to repeat the same call I made nearly eights months previous. A week from then I would see the family in Duncannon PA for the fourth of July.
Perhaps the cold front was meant to be a foreboding message, because ten miles later my rear wheel stopped spinning. A spoke had completely torn itself out of the rim, possibly due to picking up so many stray sticks from the trail. This caused the wheel to be unbalanced, terribly untrue, and completely unusable. Thankfully, a pair of cyclists from the Harper’s Ferry Hostel stopped to help and let me know I was only two miles from Point of Rocks, where I could find an inexpensive commuter train to DC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;/images/gap-cando-whitehouse.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gap-cando-whitehouse.png&quot; alt=&quot;The White House&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two miles later, I found myself at the Point of Rocks train station, with no train. The trains run inbound in the mornings and outbound in the evenings, and at noon when I arrived, I was out of luck. So I did what I do best: walk around looking sad and confused and out of luck. Within minutes I was in a little sporty BMW on my way to DC with the bike broken down in the trunk and backseat. It is incredible to realize how there are such good people left in the world. Pass it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last fifty miles of trail will have to wait. I’m tired, I’m cold, and I’ve got some sightseeing to sightsee. I’ll come back to finish up the trail, you know, just like someday I’ll go back to Maine to finish the Appalachian Trail.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2009 Escape to the Lake Prep</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year in June, the National MS Society hosts a two-day, 150-mile bicycle ride from just north of Pittsburgh to Lake Erie in Ohio. Nearly two years ago, in June 2007, I borrowed my father’s 20-year-old Univega roadbike, completely unprepared. I used to run crosscountry, but by that point I’d been two years out of practice. I hadn’t been on a bike for any length of time in at least five years, and I really had no idea if 150 miles would even be possible. However, I did manage to find a pair of padded cycling shorts at Dick’s. Of course that would more than make up for a few years of physical inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;/images/escape-to-the-lake-preliminaries-ms150.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/escape-to-the-lake-preliminaries-ms150.png&quot; alt=&quot;ms150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing about &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:line-through&quot;&gt;visiting the President&lt;/span&gt; riding the MS150 is the food! Now, since it was all free, and I wasn’t hungry but thirsty, I must’ve drank me fifteen Dr. Peppers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now February 2009, and the MS150 is coming up again in June. I’ve been on a bike consistently since September, hitting about 10 miles a day between work and school, and the Giant TCR2 is a pretty awesome bike (thank you Soursw. It’s still treating me well). With all these factors combined, I have a feeling it won’t be quite as painful as it was the first time around. But that doesn’t mean I can slack off. I have a few ideas for prep. Firstly: spring break, March 7-15. I’m thinking about riding from DC to Pittsburgh on the newly finished Great Allegheny Passage, a 318-mile bike path converted from abandoned train tracks. Although the entire trail is incredibly flat, it is not graded for road bikes, so I’ll possibly alter the course to avoid flat tires. Stay tuned for updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About MS and the National MS Society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple Sclerosis is a disease which weakens the immune system and damages the nervous system, often leading to visual problems, cognitive difficulties, and muscle weakness. The National MS Society is an organization devoted to raising awareness and funding for MS research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Standing Bear Farm</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we hiked 3.3 miles from Davenport Gap Shelter to Standing Bear Farm, where my mother sent chocolate no-bake oatmeal cookies, and my friend Jordan’s cousin Vicky sent me pictures of the upcoming trail along with a map of southwest Virginia and an invitation to a camping trip. The day off was well-needed ever since my ankle developed a sharp pain this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curtis runs the place, which provides Internet access, hand-wash laundry, and resupply. I spent some time typing up my earlier journal entries but gave up pretty quickly. A hot shower and clean clothes are a nice bonus out here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curtis explained that in the morning, the Davenport Gap Shelter crew arrives, then around noon the Cosby Knob crew shows up, and sometimes people come in from TriCorner Shelter in the afternoon and evening, so he keeps everything open and available all day and night, completely honor system. At 4 or 5 he goes for a beer/dinner run for the hikers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ted and Ryan (The Brothers Not), Haggis, OD&amp;amp;CC, Turtlefast, and Little Bear were all from these shelters and came in throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another couple spent the day with us as well, taking 5 days for a short hike between school and work. The girl left the privy in terrible condition, and the guy didn’t really talk to us at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we hope to hit 30 miles for an easy day into Hot Springs. We’ll see how that does. The weather is crappy throughout the east coast.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Night Hiking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;May 15, 2008&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Icewater Springs Shelter, Charlie and I left at 9:15am and didn’t stop until TriCorner Knob Shelter for lunch at 3pm. It was a wet, cold, windy, miserable day, but we kept on keeping on with Standing Bear Farm in mind as a goal. We passed OD&amp;amp;CC, who I failed to mention earlier. We first met OD&amp;amp;CC at Fontana Dam, where they received a large mail drop from home and left some really good food in the hiker box. I picked up Meatless Mexican Rice and Charlie picked up Chicken and Brocolli. OD, a retired Army Ranger, is hiking with his wife, and packaged his own dried meals ahead of time. Charlie is pushing OD to start a small business, starting by sending meals to Charlie once OD gets back from his section hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At lunch, we caught up to Ted, who left earlier in the morning. He joined us for the remainder of the day’s hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here it was nonstop until dinner at Cosby Knob Shelter, the most depressing shelter ever. It was completely packed with (obviously) section-hikers, Ted and Ryan (The Brothers Not), and Haggis (the Scotsman). It was 9pm when we rolled in for dinner, when most were going to sleep. There were groups of 3 or 4 people scattered about, day hikers, friends who came out to hike in the rain but ended up staring at the ground, not speaking. The Brothers Not and Haggis were great company through dinner, and when we left there was little to do but sleep. However this was only the beginning of the night for us 3 hikers. We had 7 miles to go and no sunlight.
The only thing that keeps anyone going at night is conversation. “If you were to unintentionally fall off Clingman’s Doom, what would you yell?” “How many 5-year-olds would it take to kill you? 10-year-olds?” “What would you name your Leki poles?” “Why does Charlie call every headlamp a Petzl, and every trekking pole a Leki, even though he uses Black Diamond headlamps and trekking poles?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived at 12:25am, at Davenport Gap Shelter, 27.4 miles from our starting point. Sleeping here were the couple Turtlefast and Little Bear, and the Three Canuck Girls (Mama Maple, PB, Jam).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;/images/appalachian-trail-night-hiking-3cg.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/appalachian-trail-night-hiking-3cg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Three Canuck Girls&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The three canuck girls.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me stop here to introduce the Three Canuck Girls. Ever since I left Amicalola on day one, they’ve consistently been one week ahead (from reading shelter journals) and they always have the longest, most-thought-out journal entries. It was great to finally meet them, but not under these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We caused a little ruckus getting our packs sorted out but finally went to sleep around 1am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a good reason for all of this night-hiking, and it is two-fold. If you get to a hostel at night, you’re essentially paying only to sleep, and that’s wasted money. It’s also a zero-day, which is a waste of good daylight. So the best time to get to town (or to a hostel) is early in the morning, so you have a day off without losing mileage.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mile Zero</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the side of the Greyhound in Gainesville, GA, I was collecting my baggage when I noticed a nice Osprey pack. The owner is George, “Bear Bait.” He’s taking a 30-day leave from work in Wisconsin and is trying to go as far as possible in that time. Reckons he’ll make it to Hot Springs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We split cab fare to Amicolola State Park and start from the Visitor’s Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pack Weight: 22 lbs gear, 20 lbs food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought way too much food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I realize that I still have my black backpack which was my carry-on for the bus ride. I ask the folks at the info desk if I can mail it home, and they said the first mail spot will be Neels Gap, 40 miles out. Oh well. I strapped the bag to my pack and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pack Weight: 22 lbs gear, 20 lbs food, 10 lbs crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it to the top of Springer Mountain where I met up with Scott. We met Scott earlier at the visitor’s center. He has a little less time and hopes to reach Fontana Dam before going back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shelter is “only a few yards north” of the summit. Here, we met “Gums,” a more experienced hiker. His first thru-hike was in 1970 and at this point he’s jumping from place to place, staying a few nights and moving on. What a character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;/images/appalachian-trail-day-one-gums.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/appalachian-trail-day-one-gums.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gums&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Gums&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed is also at this shelter. He was an Army Ranger, and carries an army ruck sack with some fairly heavy equipment. I’m not sure where he plans to go, but he moves fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little later, some girl and guy come by and decide to tent rather than stay in the shelter. Two girls arrive an hour later, and tent also and we never heard from them again. I guess that’ll happen here and there.
The beans I packed are awful. First thing when I get to a town: Ditch the beans. They’re heavy and taste like tree bark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Grandpa Joe&lt;/p&gt;
